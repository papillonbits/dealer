# ðŸŽ‰ Dealer App ðŸŽ‰

- Check out the dealer app in action [here](https://papillonbits.github.io/dealer/).

# ðŸ“š Features

> As a car dealer, I want to browse the cars I have in stock and give purchase recommendations tailored to the needs of my customers. More specifically the following:

## ðŸ“— Feature 1

> As a car dealer, I want to search for cars by year and make.

- ðŸ“–&nbsp; Example:
  - Given the year 2018, I should get the Citroen C3 and Honda Fit.
  - Given the brand CitroÃ«n, I should get the Citroen C3 2018.
  - Leaving the search string blank should return a list of all cars.

## ðŸ“— Feature 2

> As a car dealer, I want to be able to add new cars to my store.

- ðŸ“–&nbsp; Example:
  - I will enter the car's model, make, version, year of release, price, fuel consumption, and annual maintenance cost. The car will show up in the results returned by feature 1.

## ðŸ“— Feature 3

> As a car dealer, I want to recommend to my clients the car with the lowest total annual cost over a period of four (4) years.

- ðŸ“–&nbsp; Given the price of fuel (â‚¬/L) and the expected distance to travel each month (km/month).
- ðŸ“–&nbsp; Relevant car parameters are price of the car (â‚¬), fuel consumption (km/l), and annual maintenance cost.
- ðŸ“–&nbsp; Example:
  - Given that I expect to travel 250 km each month for the next 4 years, and the expected price of fuel is 0.73 â‚¬/L,
    what is the ranking of cars according to their total annual cost?
